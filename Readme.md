The code imports the words from the tweets.txt file which is not uploaded, but if needed will be added in order to showcase the implementation.
So basically, the main function opens the tweets.txt file and reads it simultaneosly performs the Calculate_profanity function.
Finally, the code gives the profanity degree for the tweet words. 
Thank you! Hope you liked its simplicity and beauty.
